Analyze and optimize $ARGUMENTS for performance:

1. **React Performance**
   - Unnecessary re-renders
   - Missing React.memo/useMemo/useCallback
   - Large component trees
   - Expensive computations in render

2. **Bundle Size**
   - Heavy dependencies
   - Code splitting opportunities
   - Dynamic imports for heavy components
   - Tree-shaking issues

3. **Network**
   - API call efficiency
   - Caching strategies
   - Parallel vs sequential requests
   - Unnecessary data fetching

4. **Runtime**
   - Algorithm complexity
   - Memory leaks
   - Event listener cleanup
   - Inefficient loops/filters

Provide measurable improvements with before/after comparisons when possible.
