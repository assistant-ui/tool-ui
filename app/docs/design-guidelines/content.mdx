# Design Guidelines <Badge variant="warning">Under Construction</Badge>

<div className="lead">
Core principles and patterns for designing consistent, accessible Tool UI components that provide excellent user experiences.
</div>

## Interaction Principles

### Confirmation Patterns

For destructive or significant actions, provide clear confirmation mechanisms:

- Use explicit confirm/cancel buttons for irreversible actions
- Highlight the primary action visually while keeping cancel accessible
- Provide clear context about what will happen when confirmed

### Progressive Disclosure

Reveal complexity gradually to avoid overwhelming users:

- Show essential information first, hide advanced options initially
- Use expand/collapse patterns for additional details
- Maintain context when transitioning between states

## State Management

### Loading States

- Use skeleton screens for predictable layouts
- Show spinners for indeterminate waits
- Provide progress indicators when duration is known
- Keep interactive elements disabled but visible during loading

### Empty States

- Explain why content is empty and what actions users can take
- Provide helpful guidance or call-to-action buttons
- Use friendly, encouraging language

### Error States

- Clearly describe what went wrong in plain language
- Suggest specific actions to resolve the issue
- Preserve user input when possible to avoid frustration
- Use appropriate visual indicators (color, icons) for severity

## Responsive Design

### Container Queries

Components adapt to their container size, not viewport size:

- Use container query breakpoints for component-level responsiveness
- Design components to work in narrow sidebars and wide main areas
- Test components at various container widths, not just screen sizes

### Touch Targets

- Ensure interactive elements are at least 44x44px
- Provide adequate spacing between clickable items
- Design for both mouse precision and touch interaction

## Content & Typography

### Writing Style

- Use clear, concise language that users can quickly scan
- Write action-oriented button labels (e.g., "Save changes" vs. "OK")
- Avoid jargon and technical terms when possible

### Hierarchy

- Use typography scale to establish clear visual hierarchy
- Limit heading levels to maintain clear document structure
- Use font weight and color to indicate importance

## Motion & Animation

### Purpose-Driven Motion

- Use animation to guide attention and communicate relationships
- Keep transitions subtle and quick (150-300ms typical)
- Respect user preferences with prefers-reduced-motion
- Avoid animations that are purely decorative

## Accessibility

### Semantic HTML

- Use appropriate HTML elements (button, nav, article, etc.)
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy for screen readers
- Provide meaningful alt text for images and icons

### Keyboard Navigation

- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Provide visible focus indicators with adequate contrast
- Support common keyboard shortcuts where appropriate
- Trap focus in modals and maintain logical tab order

### Color & Contrast

- Maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI)
- Never rely solely on color to convey information
- Test designs in both light and dark themes

### ARIA Labels

- Provide aria-label for icon-only buttons
- Use aria-describedby for additional context
- Keep ARIA attributes updated when content changes
- Prefer semantic HTML over ARIA when possible
