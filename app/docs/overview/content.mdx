Tool UI is a React component library for rendering rich, interactive UIs when LLMs execute tools. Built by the [assistant-ui](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui) team.

Instead of plain text, your tools return **structured JSON** that renders as **beautiful, interactive UI components** directly in your chat interface.


## Why use Tool UI?

**Predictable rendering**  
Tools emit structured, schema-validated JSON. Components render that structure consistently across conversations, themes, and devices.

**Built for chat constraints**  
Layouts are tuned for narrow viewports and stacked message flows: mobile-first, keyboard- and screen-reader friendly, with minimal chrome.

**Developer control**  
Components only render. Your app owns all side effects via callbacks like `onAction`—server actions, client handlers, routing; you decide.

**Schema-validated**  
Each component ships a serializable schema. Validate tool outputs on the server, parse them on the client, and keep types in sync.

**Stack-agnostic**  
Use any model/provider and any chat orchestration. The only contract is: “tool returns JSON that matches this schema.”


## How it works

```txt
Assistant calls tool → JSON output → <Component {...props} /> → User interacts → Your app handles it
```

The assistant decides when to call tools. Tool UI renders the output. You handle the interactions.



## Components

**Data Table** – Display structured data with sorting and row actions
**Media Card** – Preview links, images, video, and audio
**Decision Prompt** – Get binary or multi-option confirmations
**Social Post** – Display user-generated content with interactions



## Integration

Tool UI works with any React app, but integrates best with assistant-ui.

**Your backend:** Define tools that return JSON matching component schemas
**The LLM:** Decides when to call tools and fills the schemas
**Your client:** Renders components and handles user interactions

With assistant-ui you get automatic tool registration, streaming, and state management.
