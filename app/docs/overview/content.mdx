## What is Tool UI?

Tool UI provides ready-to-use React components that handle common interaction
patterns in AI-powered applications. Each component is crafted with
accessibility, responsiveness, and user experience in mind.

## Core Principles

- **Copy & Paste** - Components are standalone and easy to integrate into your
  project without complex setup
- **Accessible by Default** - Built with WCAG compliance and semantic HTML for
  screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Responsive & Adaptive** - Uses container queries to adapt to any layout,
  from mobile to desktop
- **Customizable** - Styled with Tailwind CSS and built on Radix UI, making
  them easy to theme and extend

## Components

Tool UI includes components for common AI interaction patterns:

- **Data Table** - Display and interact with structured data from tool
  responses
- **Decision Prompt** - Present choices and collect user decisions with clear
  affordances
- **Media Card** - Showcase images, videos, and rich media content
- **Social Post** - Display social media-style content with engagement patterns

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into two main sections:

- **Docs** - Conceptual guides covering design principles, architecture,
  patterns, and implementation guidelines
- **Components** - Live examples with interactive previews and copy-pasteable
  code for each component

## Tech Stack

Tool UI components are built with:

- React & TypeScript for type-safe components
- Tailwind CSS for styling with container queries
- Radix UI primitives for accessible foundations
- shadcn/ui patterns for consistency
