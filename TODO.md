# TODO

## Goals

- Refinement and polish as a key differentiator
- Visual consistency across all components
- Documentation that showcases components effectively

---

## 🎯 Active

*Currently in progress. Limit to 1-3 items.*

### WeatherDataOverlay continued polish
- [x] Use lighter font weight for location label and weekly forecast
- [x] Make high/low temperature display more interesting — unique and stylish but refined

---

## 📋 Next

*Researched, scoped, ready to start.*

- [ ] Use a nicer code theme for code block in dark mode

### Forecast card effects
- [x] At peak day/night, reduce glassy background presence (less blur, less opacity). Keep border glassy. Add mouse-tracking highlight effect.

### Shader improvements
- [ ] Clouds shader: allow clouds to become more opaque (increase density range)
- [ ] Add sky brightness/saturation controls for stormy day rendering

- [ ] Apply Vercel React best practices review across codebase
- [ ] Address performance and optimization opportunities

---

## 💡 Backlog

*Ideas and lower priority items.*

- [ ] Improve chart bars: gradient + saturated edge look like Stats Display sparklines, higher contrast

### WebGL glass exploration
- [ ] Explore rendering weekly forecast glass in WebGL with realistic tinted, refractive properties that react to weather effects

*Completed work archived in `DONE.md`*
