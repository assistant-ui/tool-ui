# TODO

## Goals

- Refinement and polish as a key differentiator
- Visual consistency across all components
- Documentation that showcases components effectively

---

## 🎯 Active

*Currently in progress. Limit to 1-3 items.*

### WeatherDataOverlay layout/text polish
- [x] Remove "Updated X ago" text/indicator
- [x] Move location text directly above temperature (not top-left corner)
- [x] Make location text semibold and slightly larger
- [x] Add more space between main temp value and °F/°C indicator
- [x] High/low row: remove gradient line, add semi-transparent "H"/"L" labels, small gap between
- [x] Fix 5-day forecast vertical centering (more space at top than bottom currently)

---

## 📋 Next

*Researched, scoped, ready to start.*

- [ ] Use a nicer code theme for code block in dark mode

### Shader improvements
- [ ] Clouds shader: allow clouds to become more opaque (increase density range)
- [ ] Add sky brightness/saturation controls for stormy day rendering

### Codebase health
- [ ] Apply Vercel React best practices review across codebase
- [ ] Address performance and optimization opportunities

---

## 💡 Backlog

*Ideas and lower priority items.*

- [ ] Improve chart bars: gradient + saturated edge look like Stats Display sparklines, higher contrast

### WebGL glass exploration
- [ ] Explore rendering weekly forecast glass in WebGL with realistic tinted, refractive properties that react to weather effects
